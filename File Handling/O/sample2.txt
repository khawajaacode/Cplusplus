File handling in C++ is a mechanism to create and perform read/write operations on a file.

We can access various file handling methods in C++ by importing the <fstream> class.

#include <fstream>
<fstream> includes two classes for file handling:

ifstream - to read from a file.
ofstream - to create/open and write to a file.
